# CICD-MAX

This project is based on a simple website from Mobirise; I am planning to do the complete CICD using Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, and Manifestfiles. On top of that I will be also including security tools like SonarQube and Trivy in my CI pipeline and ArgoCD for easier deployment. For, Monitoring and Logging I am planning to use Prometheus and ElasticSearch. And I will be also using Helm for packaging the entire manifests.
